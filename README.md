# Intermittent 500 Error in Express.js Server after Idle Time

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js server intermittently returns a 500 Internal Server Error after a period of inactivity.  The issue stems from the server's behavior after handling a request and remaining idle.  The solution addresses this issue by ensuring the server remains responsive.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that returns a response after a 5-second delay.  After the initial request, if the server remains idle for a significant time, subsequent requests might result in a 500 Internal Server Error. This is due to issues like keep-alive connections timing out or load balancing issues, but sometimes it's due to a more subtle bug in handling asynchronous operations.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution which involves maintaining the server's responsiveness by implementing a keep-alive mechanism or a heartbeat check to prevent the connection from timing out.
